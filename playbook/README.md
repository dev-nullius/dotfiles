# Initialization

To set up a Python virtual environment and install all required packages for the playbooks, run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment in `.venv` (if it doesn't exist)
- Activate the virtual environment
- Install all packages from `requirements.txt`

To activate the virtual environment in a new shell session, run:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```
## Drafts

The following plays have not yet migrated to an Ansible playbook.

### Draft: Install Yubikey Manager
In a disposable VM:
```bash 
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip python3-devel
sudo dnf install swig pcsc-lite-devel
pip install --user yubikey-manager
```

### Draft: Generate Client Keys
```bash
# Local key
ssh-keygen -o -a 100 -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -C "user@hostname"

# U2F/FIDO Security Key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519-sk -O resident -C "user@hostname"
```

### Draft: Rotate Host Keys
```bash
mkdir /etc/ssh/default_keys
mv /etc/ssh/ssh_host_* /etc/ssh/default_keys/
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
```

### Draft: Configure sshd on Host
In `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`:

```
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
```

### Draft: Add User Keys to Host
```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@hostname
```
